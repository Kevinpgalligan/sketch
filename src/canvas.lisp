  "Draws a canvas with its top-left corner at co-ordinates X & Y. By default,
uses the width and height that the canvas was created with, but these can be
overwritten by parameters WIDTH and HEIGHT.

MIN-FILTER and MAG-FILTER are used to determine pixel colours when the
drawing area is smaller or larger, respectively, than the canvas. By default,
the :LINEAR function is used. :NEAREST is also a common option.
